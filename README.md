# Gs728tpv2 Firmware Download
  
I've been updating the firmware on my GS728TPv2 from time to time for several years. Currently I have 6.0.10.17 loaded. That said, I've never seen an update for the BOOT version. Its always been 1.0.0.5. Is this the latest? Also, if there was an update to it, HOW do you update the boot software? Is the boot software a part of the firmware and it just gets updated automatically every time one does the firmware? Thanks.

If required, the Boot Loader will be updated along with the firmware update, or a specific process would be published with the firmware update release notes. Luckily, it's not required very often - because an update does inherit a major operational risk.
 
1. Though SSH has now been added to the switch.... SSH is missing in Security -> Access control section. HTTP, HTTPS, SNMP, etc is listed BUT SSH is missing! How can I add SSH to my Access Control list as I did for HTTP, HTTPS, SNMP, etc. so only specific IPs have access?

2. In the GS728TPv2 CLI manual, there is mention of how to access the CLI via TELNET but there is no mention on how to disable Telnet on the switch!!! Cannot find any way of disabling TELNET. This is a huge SECURITY HOLE. How do I disable TELNET on the switch?
 
Can you try to update the firmware to the latest version which is v6.0.10.10 then check if the same problem will occur. Be sure to clear the cache of your browser or try Incognito Mode (or In-Private Browsing) then access the web-GUI again and double-check it.
 
Telnet access can be disabled via the web-GUI of the GS728TPv2. On the web-GUI, go to Maintenance > Troubleshooting > Remote Diagnostics. When it is set to disable, the Telnet access will be disabled as well.
 
Which area of CALEA are you referring to, please? Have potentially the CALEA SSI requirements in mind? So where does it say that a device is not allowed to report a port closed instead of doing a simple connection reset?
 
However: Once you implement a filter, ACL, firewall, ... with the telnetd or sshd started, you will see nmap stating "filtered" ... because "closed" would be the IP stack dropping the connection, while "filtered" is what it is: The stack will report port closed and return the related ICMP blurb. We can dispute if the ACLs are fully closed - this is what Netgear has implemented the (misleading) telnet resp. ssh disabled.
 
Try to understand the difference between a service not active and the related IP stack answer (RST) vs. the behavior if a port is ACLed as per your desire: Then it won't RST, it will return a port not available. in reality, admins tend to have a shell access open complementing the WebUI. Depending on a firewall implementation, a firewall can show this "filtered" even of the service behind the router isn't fully down. Said that, "filtered" is not evil - it's just that nmap et all can't tell fore sure what is there.
 
Reminds me to the adventurous time where people requested a firewall "stealth" implementation -not- answering in either way (no RST, no iCMP port is not available. Mind yo: This is not RFC compliant then.
 
And I said the behavior of the disabled service is wrong. Have just explained that enabling the service and applying ACL will lead to the same effect on NMAP (and when monitoring the effective traffic). probably I was not clear either ... disadvantage of age and by not being a English language native - sorry for the confusion in case, this was not intended.
 
Just to add another example from my reports: While I like Netgear Insight, i still can't see any reason why the related daemons are still kept running in pure Web management mode. Just for the case somebody does attempt to add a device to the Insight cloud one day.
 
Dear I have just Limited power, Mainly just yet another community member who can't have his moth shut. From time to time I get the opportunity to test drive new models. But I'll see how much I can archive here.
 
If we send commands too fast, the MCU replies with fd packet. It then sends several fd packets. Even if we stop sending any more packets, it continues to send these fd replies. No indication that "system is now ready".
 
I suppose "No longer sending fd" packet is the "System is now ready" message. This is UART protocol over some optoisolators. I am not aware of any interrupt lines crossing through the isolation barrier. That leaves the actual serial messages.
 
Can't recall anything like this from the stock FW. I don't think vendor firmwares spam the MCU with frames when they don't get a timely reply, but it's been a while since I've looked at UART traces...
 
I'm curious if reducing the number of setup packets makes the "stuck at disabled" ports issue go away. Turns out it's much easier to pack more data into a command than it is to implement a reliable retry mechanism.
 
Failures for commands 23, 26, 28, and 30 might still show up in the log. Want to get some miles on this updated code and make sure that no other command is failing. If these are the only failures, then the ports have been correctly configured.
 
This looks looks like the PoE protocol but in I2C. Is there already support for this? Is it foreseen to have different backends UART/I2C? Anyway, I need to first find the I2C bus, I had not looked for it and thought PoE was straightforward serial...
 
Only thing missing now is the ability do turn off/on ports without necessarily reconfiguring the daemon. This feature was there from the beginning in the old lua code. The use case is one of the main PoE selling arguments for me: Remote power control of the connected devices, doing hard resets in a remote lab.
 
This is modelled after the lua implementation, but I felt the original one-based port index was too confusing. Especially now that we can support lots of ports. So I changed the "port" parameter into the port name.
 
Even till version CI46 of the realtek-poe package, the powerbudget is correct when /etc/config/poe is generated for different switch models. However only the number of PoE ports is still 1 when this file is generated(GS-1900 24HPv1), although the default OEM ZyXEL behaviour is that PoE is enabled on "all" available ports not just the "single" first one.
 
Since the realtek-poe package is now included in OpenWrt packages, @mrnuke shouldn't the number of default enabled ports besides power budget which are model specific in the /etc/config/poe also be generated from the info from /etc/board.d/ or somewhere else to include all PoE ports?
 
Unless you have an oszilloscope already, you can use a cheap logic analyzer to identify the protocol that is being used between the RTL SoC and the ARM microprocessor (e.g. a Nuvoton) and even decode the data. There are typically 2 low-pin-count interfaces close to that microprocessor. One that can be used to debug it and update firmware (usually SWD) and the other one to listen in on the communication with the Realtek SoC. For I2C and UART it will have 4 pins (GND/TX/RX/+3.3V for UART, for I2C it will be GND/SCL/SDA/+3.3V) and you need to connect GND and the other 2 non-3.3V pins to your logic analyzer (the 3.3V are there to support e.g. an optically isolated probe).
 
Cheap logic analyzers can be had for around 10-15 Euros/$, search for "saleae logic analyzer" on amazon, you should be able to find something that looks like this:
 =A1X7QLRQH87QA3
You can then use sigrok/pulseview on Linux to make a trace of the protocol and have it translated into what data is transferred by interpreting it either as I2C or UART.
 
You gents (and ladies ?) are reading too much into that 02-network script. It updates board.json with a "poe" object that has no consumer. Someone was looking at turning that into a proper config file that realtek-poe can use.
 
Netgear has released patches for the firmware version of more than a dozen smart switches used in corporate networks. The patches address three high impact vulnerabilities, two of which have exploit code publicly available.
 
We are an elite group of information security governance, risk & compliance experts and the forerunners in the design & delivery of innovative & effective solutions with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.
 
The bugs were patched on Friday with zero technical details made available, but the researcher has now released more details on the first two. Details on the third, Seventh Inferno, will be published after Sept. 13, he said. Netgear tracks the bugs as PSV-2021-0140, PSV-2021-0144 and PSV-2021-0145, but CVEs are pending for all three.
 
If exploited, the gear could allow cyberattackers to gain administrative privileges and completely take over the device, gaining the ability to disrupt corporate communications as well as to pivot to move laterally throughout an enterprise network.
 
Thus, to exploit the issue, an attacker on the same IP as the admin can just flood the get.cgi function with requests and snatch the session information when it appears, according to the researcher, who added that the window between get.cgi requests on the browser is one second.
 
Coldwind verified the vulnerabilities on the Netgear GS110TPV3 Smart Managed Pro Switch (and others) using firmware version 7.0.6.3 and below. However, the vendor issued an extensive list of affected models in its advisory:
 
For instance, three firmware flaws in the DGN-2200v1 series router were disclosed in July. They can enable authentication bypass to take over devices and access stored credentials using a side-channel attack.
 
And last year, researchers discovered an unpatched zero-day vulnerability in firmware that put 79 Netgear device models at risk for full takeover. Moreover, the company chose to leave 45 of those models unpatched because they were outdated or had reached their end of life.
